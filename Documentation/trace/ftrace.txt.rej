+  timestamp_mode:
+
+	Certain tracers may change the timestamp mode used when
+	logging trace events into the event buffer.  Events with
+	different modes can coexist within a buffer but the mode in
+	effect when an event is logged determines which timestamp mode
+	is used for that event.  The default timestamp mode is
+	'delta'.
+
+	Usual timestamp modes for tracing:
+
+	  # cat timestamp_mode
+	  [delta] absolute
+
+	  The timestamp mode with the square brackets around it is the
+	  one in effect.
+
+	  delta: Default timestamp mode - timestamp is a delta against
+	         a per-buffer timestamp.
+
+	  absolute: The timestamp is a full timestamp, not a delta
+                 against some other value.  As such it takes up more
+                 space and is less efficient.
